## 📌 What is LangGraph?  
LangGraph is an **open-source orchestration framework** for building **agentic AI applications**.  

While **LangChain** gives you modular building blocks (models, prompts, memory, tools), **LangGraph** is all about **connecting those blocks into graphs (workflows)** where you can:  
- Define **control flows** (sequential, parallel, branching, multi-agent).  
- Add **memory & persistence** so your agents don’t “forget.”  
- Stream **token-by-token outputs** for better UX.  
- Enable **human-in-the-loop (HITL)** controls.  
- Scale to production with monitoring, APIs, and deployment.  

👉 Think of LangGraph as the **workflow engine** that powers **reliable AI agents**.

## 🚀 Why LangGraph?  
Traditional agents often struggle with:  
- ❌ **Lack of control** → one “black-box” LLM call.  
- ❌ **No persistence** → forget everything between sessions.  
- ❌ **Unreliable outputs** → no structured control, hard to debug.  
- ❌ **Scaling pain** → brittle once you move from prototype → production.  

**LangGraph solves this**:  
- ✅ **Graph-based orchestration** → Explicit control flows.  
- ✅ **Memory across runs** → Context persistence (short & long term).  
- ✅ **Human oversight** → Review, approve, or override agent actions.  
- ✅ **Streaming & transparency** → Real-time outputs, reasoning, and tool use visible.  
- ✅ **Production-ready** → Fault tolerance, APIs, observability with LangSmith.

## 🧩 Core Features  

### 1️⃣ Flexible Agent Architectures  
- **Single agent**: A straightforward chatbot or assistant.  
- **Multi-agent**: Agents that collaborate (e.g., researcher + writer).  
- **Hierarchical agents**: Supervisor agent delegates tasks to workers.  
- **Branching logic**: If/else flows (e.g., route queries to different agents).  

---

### 2️⃣ Memory & Persistence  
- **Conversation memory** → Store chat history.  
- **Long-term persistence** → Keep context between sessions.  
- **Custom state stores** → E.g., user preferences, task state.  

👉 Example:  
A customer support agent remembers **who you are, your last ticket, and product settings** across multiple conversations.  

---

### 3️⃣ Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)  
- Insert checkpoints where a **human moderator approves/rejects agent actions**.  
- Useful in sensitive domains: healthcare, finance, legal, compliance.  

---

### 4️⃣ Streaming Support  
- Stream outputs **token by token** for a responsive UX.  
- Stream **tool calls & reasoning steps** for transparency.  

👉 Example:  
Instead of waiting 30 seconds for a full answer, the user sees the response typing out in real-time.  

---

### 5️⃣ Developer Tools & Observability  
- **LangGraph Studio** → Visual editor for workflows.  
- **LangSmith integration** → Logging, monitoring, debugging.  
- **Time travel debugging** → Inspect agent state at any point.  

---

### 6️⃣ Deployment Options  
- **Open Source (LangGraph Library)**:  
  - Python & JavaScript SDKs.  
  - You handle infra, persistence, and scaling.  

- **LangGraph Platform**:  
  - Managed hosting + APIs.  
  - Built-in persistence, scaling, fault tolerance.  
  - Hybrid cloud options.

## ⚙️ Installation  

```bash
# Python
pip install langgraph

# JavaScript
npm install @langchain/langgraph
```

---

## 📖 Quick Example (Python)  

```python
from langgraph import GraphAgent, Memory

# Create an agent with persistence and streaming
agent = GraphAgent(
    name="SupportAgent",
    memory=Memory(persistence=True),
    streaming=True
)

response = agent.run("Check my last order status and apply a discount.")
print(response)
```

👉 Notes:  
- The **graph** defines the workflow: “fetch order → check eligibility → apply discount.”  
- The **memory** ensures continuity across multiple user sessions.  
- **Streaming** improves user experience with real-time output.  

---

## 🔄 Example: Multi-Agent Setup  

```python
from langgraph import Graph, Agent

# Define two agents
researcher = Agent(name="Researcher", role="Gather information")
writer = Agent(name="Writer", role="Summarize into blog post")

# Define graph (workflow)
graph = Graph()
graph.add_node(researcher)
graph.add_node(writer)

graph.add_edge(researcher, writer)  # researcher → writer

response = graph.run("Write a blog post on AI agents in healthcare.")
print(response)
```

---

## 🎯 Use Cases  

- 🤖 **Customer support assistants** with memory & escalation workflows.  
- 📚 **Research pipelines**: one agent fetches data, another summarizes.  
- 🏦 **Finance & compliance agents**: automate tasks with HITL reviews.  
- 📝 **Content pipelines**: idea → research → drafting → review.  
- 🏭 **Enterprise automation**: multi-step workflows with API integrations.

## 🔧 LangGraph vs LangChain  

| Feature | LangChain | LangGraph |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Building blocks (models, prompts, memory, tools, retrievers) | Orchestration of agents & workflows |
| **Focus** | Individual components | Connecting components into control flows |
| **Memory** | Short-term, per-component | Persistent, graph-level |
| **Agents** | Simple tool-using agents | Complex, multi-agent workflows |
| **Best For** | Prototyping | Production-grade orchestration |

👉 Use **LangChain** for prototyping AI-powered features.  
👉 Use **LangGraph** when you need **complex, stateful, multi-agent systems**.
